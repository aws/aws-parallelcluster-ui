This involves reducing the number of mocks to the minimum (e.g. - only expensive third party APIs).\n\nIn the case of PCUI, this would involve a lot of infrastructure being moved (e.g. creating a cluster) and it would add many dependencies to every test (ParallelCluster, the underlying AWS infrastructure, CloudFormation and so on). It would make the tests very costly, with little to no actual improvement in the confidence that PCUI is working as expected.\n\nLast but not least, PC provides a powerful dry-run feature that allows PCUI to quickly verify most of its features.\n\n## Decision\nIn PCUI, e2e tests will avoid involving costly tests such as an actual cluster creation\n\n## Consequences\n- Cheaper, much quicker tests\n- More or less the same level of confidence in the stability of PCUI"},"creationDate":"2023-03-10T10:42:36.000Z","lastEditDate":"2023-03-10T10:42:36.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Alessandro Menduni","publicationDate":"2023-03-10T22:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"decisions/20230310-scope-down-e2e-tests.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/aws-parallelcluster-ui/aws-parallelcluster-ui/decisions/20230310-scope-down-e2e-tests.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster-ui/blob/master/decisions/20230310-scope-down-e2e-tests.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
