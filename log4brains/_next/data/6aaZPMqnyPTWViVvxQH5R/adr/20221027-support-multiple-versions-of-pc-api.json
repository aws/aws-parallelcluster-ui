There is no central point where all the features we support are listed and it is getting hard to keep track of all the moving parts whenever a new version of the PC api is released\n\n## Decision\nUse feature flags to toggle on and off features. Generate the list of active flags based on the current version of the PC api.\n\n## Consequences\n- Upside: We have a single point where every feature is listed, and a single map to manage which feature maps to which version.\n- Downside: We still have to maintain different UIs and it may get very hard to test every combination of features in the long run."},"creationDate":"2022-10-27T13:29:31.000Z","lastEditDate":"2022-10-27T13:29:31.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Alessandro Menduni","publicationDate":"2022-10-27T21:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"decisions/20221027-support-multiple-versions-of-pc-api.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/aws-parallelcluster-ui/aws-parallelcluster-ui/decisions/20221027-support-multiple-versions-of-pc-api.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster-ui/blob/master/decisions/20221027-support-multiple-versions-of-pc-api.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
