This is not always the desired behavior, especially when an amend is made to the documentation for unreleased ParallelCluster or ParallelCluster Manager features.\n\n## Decision\nChange the documentation workflow's trigger to run only on releases.\n\n## Consequences\nThe documentation is updated only when ParallelCluster Mananager is released to customers. The downside is quick fixes to the documentation require more time to be released.\n"},"creationDate":"2022-10-25T07:38:00.000Z","lastEditDate":"2022-10-25T07:38:00.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Mattia Franchetto","publicationDate":"2022-10-24T21:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"decisions/20221025-public-documentation-release.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/aws-parallelcluster-ui/aws-parallelcluster-ui/decisions/20221025-public-documentation-release.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster-ui/blob/master/decisions/20221025-public-documentation-release.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
