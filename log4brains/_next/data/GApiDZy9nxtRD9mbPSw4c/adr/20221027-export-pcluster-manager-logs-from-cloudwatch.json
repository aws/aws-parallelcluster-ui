Right now there is no way from the PCM UI to be guided in performing the\nnecessary actions to download log files produced by the application.\nSince a complete automation and a 1-click experience are not feasible right now with what we have, we cannot provide\ncustomers with an immediate way to get logs and some manual process would still be necessary,\n(pre-signed URL for S3 are only possible for single objects and not collection of objects), so right now we decided to\nskip the automation part entirely.\n\n## Decision\nGuide the users with documentation links and/or instructions on how to perform an [export to s3 action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/S3ExportTasks.html)\nletting them know what is needed and how to download log archives.\n\n## Consequences\nHelping customers solve their issues will become easier and more manageable,\nalthough part of the manual process may be error-prone for users less acquainted with AWS console.\n"},"creationDate":"2022-10-27T14:20:16.000Z","lastEditDate":"2022-10-27T15:03:32.000Z","lastEditAuthor":"Marco Basile","publicationDate":"2022-10-27T21:59:59.000Z","file":{"relativePath":"decisions/20221027-export-pcluster-manager-logs-from-cloudwatch.md","absolutePath":"/home/runner/work/aws-parallelcluster-ui/aws-parallelcluster-ui/decisions/20221027-export-pcluster-manager-logs-from-cloudwatch.md"},"repository":{"provider":"github","viewUrl":"https://github.com/aws/aws-parallelcluster-ui/blob/master/decisions/20221027-export-pcluster-manager-logs-from-cloudwatch.md"}},"l4bVersion":"1.0.1"},"__N_SSG":true}
