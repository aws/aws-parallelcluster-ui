# Project Guidelines

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated. Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

- You have added tests, even if just the happy path, when adding or refactoring code
- You used types in your TypeScript code so that we can leverage static analysis to maintain quality
- You have internationalized any user-facing text or copy, by using [`react-i18next`](https://react.i18next.com/) library ([useTranslation hook](https://react.i18next.com/latest/usetranslation-hook) and/or [Trans component](https://react.i18next.com/latest/trans-component)) so that we can translate to other languages in the future
- You have followed the PR Quality Checklist available in our [Pull Request Template](.github/pull_request_template.md)
